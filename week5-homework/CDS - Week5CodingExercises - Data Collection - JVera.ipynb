We do not need to eat all the time and if you feel that you are hungry all the time you may want to start evaluating the micronutrients that you are or are not consuming.  Lots of greens and large salads were key for me. Monomeals also played a huge part in me defeating my food addictions. Tofu is a great source of protein but we get enough of that already. Beans are too. The greens will give you things like calcium magnesium all of your B vitamins, folate, and other stuff too. Why do you think you have to replace anything? On a high fat low carb diet I am sure that like with many other people, you were over fed and under nourished. This journey starts with a shift in one's thinking and realizing that the high protein animal consumption stuff is just marketing and most doctors don't know any more about nutrition than you do. They are not taught that. I have done over 13 years of reading the research on nutritional science and human biochemistry as it relates to nutrition. I have experimented on myself as well and the science I have reviewed definitely held true with me and many others. You just need patients. Don't worry about the end result. Take it one day at a time. If you mess up get back up tomorrow and start again. Like I said before read mastering diabetes. Read Neil Barnard's books on diabetes and more. You are at an early stage if I remember right. All fats need to be at a low percentage and apps like cronometer.com are great tools in doing so. What do you consider satisfying for your appetite? What does that feel like to you? For me, it means I am no longer hungry. It used to mean my belly felt as though it couldn't hold any more.\",\n",

       "   'body': '&gt;The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;...  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons — the modern working class — the proletarians.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;...  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\\- The Communist Manifesto\\n\\nA lot of people here seem to forget that Marx saw much of this as having played an important and necessary historical role in the development of humankind. Marxism comes out of the Radical Enlightenment and is aimed at individualism, at liberating the individual from class, not at recreating traditional societal bonds.',\n",
